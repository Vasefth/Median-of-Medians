# Median-of-Medians
The Median of Medians algorithm is a divide-and-conquer approach used to find the median of a dataset with linear time complexity.

In computer science, the median of medians is an approximate median selection algorithm, frequently used to supply a good pivot for an exact selection algorithm, most commonly quickselect, that selects the kth smallest element of an initially unsorted array. Median of medians finds an approximate median in linear time.
